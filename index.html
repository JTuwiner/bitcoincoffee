<p>At this stage the Bitcoin <del>scaling</del> debate is not about scaling. It's all about coffee.</p>

<p>Many in the community just want their coffee and don't care if it's on-chain or off-chain. </p> 

<h2>On-Chain Coffee Lovers at Risk of Attack</h2>

<p>To highlight the severity of the debate, we'll start off by showing the dangers of showing your support for either side.</p>

<p>Yours developer Ryan X. Charles risked his life when he publicly admitted to liking his coffee ON-CHAIN! For the rest of his life, the small block, off-chain coffee extremists may attack or DDOS him. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have to say it: I want to buy coffee on-chain. *prepares for DDoS, defamation, &amp; hacking from small block extremists*</p>&mdash; Ryan X.

<h2>Why Buy Coffee with Bitcoin?</h2>

<p>Buying coffee with Bitcoin is a great feeling. Honestly, it's not <i>that</i> crazy we've had two years of debate.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I just dropped my oldest son off for a government field trip, then went and bought my coffee with bitcoin. ‚úäüèª<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ironic?src=hash">#ironic</a> ‚Äî feeling empowered</p>&mdash; Andrew D. Goodfellow (@80g) <a href="https://twitter.com/80g/status/849947084421828608">April 6, 2017</a></blockquote>

<h2>The Early Warning Signs</h2>

<p>Back in 2015, Roger Ver made a 100% accurate tweet about coffee and the free market vs government programs.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If I don&#39;t like <a href="https://twitter.com/Starbucks">@starbucks</a> I&#39;m free to buy coffee somewhere else. If I don&#39;t like <a href="https://twitter.com/SocialSecurity">@socialsecurity</a> I&#39;ll go to prison if I save somewhere else</p>&mdash; Roger Ver (@rogerkver) <a href="https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/607343179487023104">June 7, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Apparently, this was at a time when Roger was still able to buy his coffee on-chain. He was not outraged about coffee at this point, but it was a sign of things to come.</p>

<p>In June 2016, Roger made a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-block-space-starbucks-coffee/">post titled</a> "Why Bitcoin Block Space is like Starbucks Coffee".</p>

<img src="/img/bc.png"> 

<p>Perhaps this line of thinking is what's driving his support for on-chain coffee solutions like Bitcoin Unlimited. </p>

<p>Although most of the debate is about whether coffee should be purchased using on-chain or off-chain Bitcoin transactions, Roger is also now concerned over whether coffee purchases are <i>defined</i> as micro-transactions or not.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Buying a cup of coffee is not a micro transaction&quot;</p>&mdash; Roger Ver (@rogerkver) <a href="https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/850350068049747968">April 7, 2017</a></blockquote>

<h2>Satoshi Wanted His Coffee On-Chain and Off-Chain</h2>

<p>Satoshi's whitepaper is like the Bible in the Bitcoin Coffee Debate. We must follow it to a point.</p>

<p>The problem? </p> 

<p>Satoshi never mentioned coffee in the whitepaper. This has left it up for debate whether or not Satoshi liked his coffee on-chain or off-chain.</p>

<p>According to Charlie Shrem, Satoshi liked off-chain coffee!</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Those claiming to &quot;follow Satoshi&#39;s vision&quot; ignore that even he said <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash">#Bitcoin</a> wasn&#39;t practical for cup of coffee on-chain. 2nd layer <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SegWit?src=hash">#SegWit</a> <a href="https://t.co/uovdoZpK14">pic.twitter.com/uovdoZpK14</a></p>&mdash; Charlie Shrem (@CharlieShrem) <a href="https://twitter.com/CharlieShrem/status/847113098712530945">March 29, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><a href="https://lamassu.is/">Lamassu</a> Bitcoin ATM founder Josh Harvey, however, believes Satoshi preferred on-chain coffee:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Jim_Harper">@Jim_Harper</a> Here in Sofia, a coffee+cookie is $0.50.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2>Do Prominent Bitcoin Figures Like Their Coffee On or Off-Chain?</h2>

<p>Litecoin creator Charlie Lee personally prefers his coffee on-chain, although it's not clear whether Charlie has ever taste tested off-chain coffee. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/ShitcoinJesus">@ShitcoinJesus</a> Yes, you can! And coffee taste better when bought on-chain.</p>&mdash; Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) <a href="https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/853515740573425664">April 16, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>While it's not clear if Charlie Shrem has actually taste tested on-chain vs. off-chain coffee, he clearly believes Segwit is the best solution for all those on-chain coffee lovers:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you want to buy coffee on-chain, activate <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SegWit?src=hash">#SegWit</a> (tested, vetted, ready).

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Like Charlie Shrem, Oleg Andreev has not made it clear whether he has tried both on-chain and off-chain coffee. But it looks like he's had an opinion in this coffee debate since 2014, when he claimed that, unfortunately, all coffee transactions may need to be off-chain.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ll need off-chain clearing network with IOUs protected by bilateral deposits on blockchain anyway ‚Äî for micropayments and coffee.</p>&mdash; Oleg Andreev (@oleganza) <a href="https://twitter.com/oleganza/status/522757435053060096">October 16, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Well-respected cryptographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo">Nick Szabo</a> has even weighed in on the debate. While not mentioned directly, it appears Szabo would also prefer his coffees off-chain.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When buying a coffee, security is not a high priority.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Bruce Fenton used to think coffee was Bitcoin's killer app, but as of March 29, 2017 his opinion has changed.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yrs ago we had grand visions of everyone buying coffee w Bitcoin.<br>Personally my vision has changed &amp; I don‚Äôt now see coffee as a killer app</p>&mdash; Bruce Fenton (@brucefenton) <a href="https://twitter.com/brucefenton/status/846800610594820102">March 28, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Famous Twitter personality WhalePanda also believes Bitcoin coffee payments are meant to be off-chain.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/edbwt">@edbwt</a> Bitcoin is digital gold and store of value, it isn&#39;t made to buy your coffee with it.</p>&mdash; WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhalePanda/status/848479084267134976">April 2, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Dan Held, the founder of ZeroBlock and former <a href="https://blockchain.info/">Blockchain.info</a> employee, also agrees with WhalePanda:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Value prop for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash">#bitcoin</a> is gold 2.0.

<p><a href="https://www.bitpremier.com/">BitPremier</a> founder Alan Silbert also wants to see coffee transactions off-chain on Lightning.</p>

<h2>Does On-Chain Coffee Even Exist?</h2>

<p>Twitter user Arno Laeven‚Äè makes a good point: </p> 

<p>Since baristas are not embedded into the Bitcoin blockchain, an off-chain barista will ALWAYS be making your coffee. So, regardless, technically all coffees are still off-chain.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Steve_Lockstep">@steve_lockstep</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/wmougayar">@wmougayar</a> you cannot pay a coffee with btc without an off-chain barista making the actual coffee either</p>&mdash; Arno Laeven (@alaeven) <a href="https://twitter.com/alaeven/status/828566413271040000">February 6, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2>Off-Chain Coffee is Better For the Environment</h2>

<p>According to Mandrik, User Ops Manager at Blockchain.info, off-chain coffee is better for the environment because it may push people to make coffee at home instead. Drinking coffee at home prevents the need to make both an on-chain or off-chain transaction. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/keonne">@keonne</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/fonebtc">@fonebtc</a> This is why off-chain coffee solutions are better.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>As if we needed another Blockstream conspiracy, Keonne Rodriguez, former Product Lead at Blockchain.info, makes a great point: </p>
 
<p>Perhaps BlockstreamCore just wants it to be MUCH harder for people to buy coffee at all so less plastic and waste goes into landfills?</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Blockstream Core don&#39;t want 25k tonnes of coffee on chain . Satoshi did!

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2>Blockstream / Starbucks Partnership</h2>

<p>Blockstream, the evil company that contributes more to Bitcoin development than any company, even formed an exclusive partnership to sell coffee ON-CHAIN to the world's 7 billion people. Remember this despite claims that Blockstream is trying to push all of the world's coffees off-chain.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Blockstream is excited to announce a partnership with <a href="https://twitter.com/Starbucks">@Starbucks</a> to sell coffee on-chain to all 7-billion people worldwide! <a href="https://t.co/wMchwDWcOs">pic.twitter.com/wMchwDWcOs</a></p>&mdash; Blockstream (@Blockstream) <a href="https://twitter.com/Blockstream/status/848324511992692736">April 2, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In one of the few things Blockstream and Roger Ver agree on, both REALLY like Starbucks coffee. Most mentions of coffee by both also include a reference to Starbucks. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thinking blocks should always be full is analogous to thinking Starbucks should always be sold out of coffee. <a href="https://t.co/yrvl2jN4xO">https://t.co/yrvl2jN4xO</a></p>&mdash; Roger Ver (@rogerkver) <a href="https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/747417214047817729">June 27, 2016</a></blockquote>

<h2>The Unnecessary Samson Mow vs Roger Ver Debate</h2>

<p>On April 11, 2017, Roger Ver challenged Samson Mow, Chief Strategy Officer at Blockstream, to a scaling debate:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I hear Samson is in town again. Let&#39;s have a public debate on why he wants to deviate so substantially from Bitcoin&#39;s original road map. <a href="https://t.co/lPcwWpASwF">pic.twitter.com/lPcwWpASwF</a></p>&mdash; Roger Ver (@rogerkver) <a href="https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/851714370128171008">April 11, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The reality is this debate doesn't need to happen, since Samson already agrees with Roger that Bitcoin Unlimited would be a GREAT way to buy coffee on-chain.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first thing I&#39;m going to do with my BTU coins is spend 1,000 of them to buy coffee on-chain. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/celebrate?src=hash">#celebrate</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/unlimited?src=hash">#unlimited</a></p>&mdash; Samson Mow (@Excellion) <a href="https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/841550536730071040">March 14, 2017</a></blockquote>

<h2>The Real Satoshi</h2>

<p>During my research for this site, I believe I found the real Satoshi.</p>

<p>Let's forget Dorian Nakamoto. If he was the real Satoshi he would have asked for free coffee instead of free lunch. </p>

<p>We don't even need to mention Craig Wright. He would have proved he was Satoshi by buying an on-chain coffee with coins from the first block.</p>

<p>This guy must be Satoshi. Since it's his name, and he LOVES coffee.</p>
