<p>It's this stage the Bitcoin <del>scaling</del> debate is not about scaling. It is about coffee.</p>

<h2>The Early Warning Signs</h2>

<p>Back in 2015, Roger Ver made a 100% accurate tweet about coffee and the free market vs government programs.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If I don&#39;t like <a href="https://twitter.com/Starbucks">@starbucks</a> I&#39;m free to buy coffee somewhere else. If I don&#39;t like <a href="https://twitter.com/SocialSecurity">@socialsecurity</a> I&#39;ll go to prison if I save somewhere else</p>&mdash; Roger Ver (@rogerkver) <a href="https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/607343179487023104">June 7, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>Apparently, this was at a time that Roger was still able to buy his coffee on-chain. He was not outraged about coffee at this point, but it was a sign of things to come.</p>

<h2>Satoshi Wanted His Coffee On-Chain and Off-Chain</h2>

<p>Satoshi's whitepaper is like the Bible in the Bitcoin Coffee Debate. We must follow it to a point.</p>

<p>The problem is, Satoshi never mentioned coffee in the whitepaper. This has left it up for debate whether or not Satoshi liked his coffee on-chain or off-chain.</p>

<p>According to Charlie Shrem, Satoshi like OFF-CHAIN coffee!</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Those claiming to &quot;follow Satoshi&#39;s vision&quot; ignore that even he said <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash">#Bitcoin</a> wasn&#39;t practical for cup of coffee on-chain. 2nd layer <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SegWit?src=hash">#SegWit</a> <a href="https://t.co/uovdoZpK14">pic.twitter.com/uovdoZpK14</a></p>&mdash; Charlie Shrem (@CharlieShrem) <a href="https://twitter.com/CharlieShrem/status/847113098712530945">March 29, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>Lamassu Bitcoin ATM founder Josh Harvey, however, believes Satoshi preferred on-chain coffee:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Jim_Harper">@Jim_Harper</a> Here in Sofia, a coffee+cookie is $0.50. I think Satoshi would still want to buy it on-chain. Off-chain is sensitive subject :P</p>&mdash; Josh Harvey (@joshmh) <a href="https://twitter.com/joshmh/status/847439939415486465">March 30, 2017</a></blockquote>

<h2>On-Chain Coffee Lovers at Risk of Attack</h2>

<p>In a daring tweet, Yours developer Ryan X. Charles publicly admitted he likes his coffee ON-CHAIN! For the rest of his life, the small block, off-chain coffee extremists may attack or DDOS him. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have to say it: I want to buy coffee on-chain. *prepares for DDoS, defamation, &amp; hacking from small block extremists*</p>&mdash; Ryan X. Charles (@ryanxcharles) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanxcharles/status/844805413656707074">March 23, 2017</a></blockquote>

<h2>Blockstream / Starbucks Partnership</h2>

<p>Blockstream, the evil company that contributes more to Bitcoin development than any company, even formed an exclusive partnership to sell coffee ON-CHAIN to the world's 7 billion people. Remember this despite claims that Blockstream is trying to push all of the world's coffees off-chain.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Blockstream is excited to announce a partnership with <a href="https://twitter.com/Starbucks">@Starbucks</a> to sell coffee on-chain to all 7-billion people worldwide! <a href="https://t.co/wMchwDWcOs">pic.twitter.com/wMchwDWcOs</a></p>&mdash; Blockstream (@Blockstream) <a href="https://twitter.com/Blockstream/status/848324511992692736">April 2, 2017</a></blockquote>

<h2>My Personal Taste</h2>

<p>I've mostly tried to stay out of the scaling debate. But after buying coffee both on-chain and off-chain, the taste to me is the same. </p>

<p>I just want to use my damn bitcoins to buy coffee.</p>
